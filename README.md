# 🧠 ReMind – An Agentic AI Recall Assistant

## 📘 Project Description
**ReMind** is an interactive, memory-aware AI system built using Python that helps users retain knowledge by periodically revisiting and testing what they’ve learned in previous conversations.  
The project uses an **agentic approach** — the AI not only responds to user queries but also proactively engages with the user after a few prompts to check their understanding of past topics.

The assistant maintains a structured memory of past interactions, identifies key learning points, and, after a certain interval, generates personalized recall questions. This approach reinforces long-term memory retention, similar to how human tutors use spaced repetition.

The system can be run as a command-line chatbot or integrated with front-end tools like **Streamlit**  for an interactive experience. It can also evaluate user responses, give feedback, and adapt its questioning style based on user performance.

## 💬 Example Use Case
1. User asks the AI a series of questions.  
2. After 5 prompts, the AI picks one earlier topic and quizzes the user.  
3. The AI evaluates the user’s answer and provides feedback.  
4. The process repeats, reinforcing memory and understanding over time.
